Note : 
The Taxiora application UI is much more complex (Multiple settings and configurations).
Not a quick-to-use :
- Driver can easily missclick between options 
	- Scenario to keep in mind : A Taxi Driving working during midday. summer weather. no AC. Probably too sunny to even see the display at this point.

The main and ONLY clients for the Taxiora Device are These Taxi Drivers. 
Meaning : If there is no extra income going to be provided from using the Taxiora Application. They probably not going to even bother.
Argument : not a single taxi driver in Tunisia uses a printer. Why ? unnecessary expense.
